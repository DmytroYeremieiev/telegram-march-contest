# Telegram's 2019 April 7-15 contest for UI developers:

**Dates**: April 7-15. The last submission will be accepted via @jobs_bot at 11:59 PM CET, April 15.
Prize budget: at least $150,000 to be distributed among the winners.

**Goal**: Build 5 graphs based on the input data we provide. In addition to line charts developed in Stage 1, we are inviting developers to support 3 new chart types: line charts with 2 Y axes, bar charts and percentage stacked area charts.

Those who aim for the first prize will also have to support the zoom in / zoom out feature and pie charts. Zooming in allows to expand each data point into another graph with a more detailed X-axis. For example, each point on a 365-day daily graph can be zoomed into a 24-hour graph on a 168-hour timeline, as shown on one of the video demonstrations below.

**Datasets for each graph**: [./chart_data.json](https://github.com/DmytroYeremieiev/telegram-march-contest/blob/master/chart_data.json)
